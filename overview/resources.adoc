= Skupper resources on Kubernetes

The following sections describe the various Skupper resources on Kubernetes, for example, service accounts


== Service accounts, roles and role bindings

When you create a Skupper site, the following resources are created.


skupper-service-controller:: A service account, role and role binding with this name are created to manage the Skupper service controller.

skupper-router:: A service account, role and role binding with this name are created to manage the Skupper router.



== Deployments

Each Skupper site on Kubernetes consists of two deployments:

skupper-router:: provides the data plane for the {service-network}.

skupper-service-controller:: provides the control plane for the {service-network}.


== ConfigMaps

Do not edit these ConfigMap values directly.

skupper-site:: site settings, including:
+
--
* console authentication
* ingress strategy

This ConfigMap is the root object for all the skupper resources; deleting it will remove the Skupper deployment from the namespace.
--

skupper-services:: internal representation of the services available on the {service-network}.

skupper-internal:: internal router configuration.
The service controller determines the values in this ConfigMap based on the services available on the {service-network}.

== Secrets


Each site has two `kubernetes.io/tls` type secrets, *skupper-local-ca* and *skupper-site-ca*:

skupper-local-ca:: issues certs for local access. 
+
--
The local certs are held in:  

* *skupper-local-client* used by the service controller.
* *skupper-local-server* used by the router.
--

skupper-site-ca:: issues certs for remote access.
+
--
The site ca issued certs are *skupper-site-server* which holds the certs that identify the router to other routers that link to this site, *skupper-claims-server* which identifies the claims service, which is part of the service controller and is used when another site first established a link to exchange a restricted use token for a TLS certificate and *skupper-console-certs* which holds certs for the console.
--


The tokens used to establish links creates the following secrets with variable names:
+
--
* The site that issues a claim token generates a secret with a UUID name that contains details of any usage restrictions, for example, the number of times you can use the token to create a link and the amount of time the token is valid for.

* The site establishing the link will have a secret that contains the token claim or certificate. 
These secrets are typically called `link1`, `link2`, and so on. 
--

skupper-console-users::
If you configure console authentication using the default `internal` mode, this secret is created and contains the username(s) and password(s) that can be used to access the console. 
A username and password can be specified using `skupper init --console-user <username> --console-password <password>`.
If a username and password are not specified, an `admin` user is created with a generated password.

== Services

In addition to the services that are exposed on the {service-network}, the following services are created:

skupper-router-local:: The service controller uses this service to connect to and configure the router. 

skupper-router:: Other sites use this service to access the router over the inter-router or edge ports, although there may be other resources involved, for example, an ingress. 

skupper:: The console and claims-server are accessed through this service.
