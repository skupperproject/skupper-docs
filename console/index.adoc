= Using the Skupper console



The Skupper console provides data and visualizations of the traffic flow between Skupper sites.


// Type: procedure
[id="enabling-console"] 
== Enabling the Skupper console

By default, when you create a Skupper site, a Skupper console is not available.

When enabled, the Skupper console URL is displayed whenever you check site status using `skupper status`.

.Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes namespace where you plan to create a site

.Procedure

. Determine which site in your {service-network} is best to enable the console.
+
--
Enabling the console also requires that you enable the flow-collector component, which requires resources to process traffic data from all sites.
You might locate the console using the following criteria:

* Does the {service-network} cross a firewall?
For example, if you want the console to be available only inside the firewall, you need to locate the flow-collector and console on a site inside the firewall.

* Is there a site that processes more traffic than other sites?
For example, if you have a _frontend_ component that calls a set of services from other sites, it might make sense to locate the flow collector and console on that site to minimize data traffic.

* Is there a site with more or cheaper resources that you want to use?
For example, if you have two sites, A and B, and resources are more expensive on site A, you might want to locate the flow collector and console on site B.
--

. Create a site with the flow collector and console enabled:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ skupper init --enable-console --enable-flow-collector
----

// Type: procedure
[id="accessing-console"] 
== Accessing the Skupper console

By default, the Skupper console is protected by credentials available in the `skupper-console-users` secret.


.Procedure

. Determine the Skupper console URL using the `skupper` CLI, for example:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ skupper status

Skupper is enabled for namespace "west" in interior mode. It is not connected to any other sites. It has no exposed services.
The site console url is:  https://skupper-west.apps-crc.testing
----

. Browse to the Skupper console URL. 
The credential prompt depends on how the site was created using `skupper init`:
+
* Using the `--console-auth unsecured` option, you are not prompted for credentials.
* Using the `--console-auth openshift` option, you are prompted to enter OpenShift cluster credentials.
* Using the default or `--console-user <user>  --console-password <password>` options, you are prompted to enter those credentials.

. If you created the site using default settings, that is `skupper init`, a random password is generated for the `admin` user.
To retrieve the password the `admin` user:
+
----
$ kubectl get secret skupper-console-users -o jsonpath={.data.admin} | base64 -d

[id="exploring-console"] 
== Exploring the Skupper console

After exposing a service on the {service-network}, you create an _address_, that is, a service name and port number associated with a site. 
There might be many replicas associated with an address.
These replicas are shown in the Skupper console as _processes_. 
Not all participants on a {service-network} are services.
For example, a _frontend_ deployment might call an exposed service named _backend_, but that frontend is not part of the {service-network}.
In the console, both are shown so that you can view the traffic and these are called _components_.

The Skupper console provides an overview of the following:

* Topology 
* Addresses
* Sites
* Components
* Processes


The Skupper console also provides useful networking information about the {service-network}, for example, traffic levels.

. Check the *Sites* tab.
All your sites should be listed.
See the *Topology* tab to view how the sites are linked.

. Check that all the services you exposed are visible in the *Components* tab.

. Click a component to show the component details and associated processes.

. Click on a process to display the process traffic.
+
NOTE: The process detail displays the associated image, host, and addresses.
You can also view the clients that are calling the process.

. Click *Addresses* and choose an address to show the details for that address. This shows the set of servers that are exposed across the {service-network}.
