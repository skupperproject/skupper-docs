== Accessing the {skupper-name} console

By default, the {skupper-name} console is available whenever you create a {service-network} router and is protected by credentials available in the `skupper-console-users` secret.


.Procedure

. Determine the {skupper-name} console URL using the `skupper` CLI, for example:
+
----
$ skupper status
Skupper is enabled for namespace "west" in interior mode. It is not connected to any other sites. It has no exposed services.
The site console url is:  https://skupper-controller-west.apps-crc.testing
----

. Browse to the {skupper-name} console URL. The credential prompt depends on how the site was created:
+
* using the `--console-auth unsecured` option, you are not prompted for credentials.
* using the `--console-auth openshift` option, you are prompted to enter OpenShift cluster credentials.
* using the default or `--console-user <user>  --console-password <password>` options, you are prompted to enter {skupper-name} credentials.

. If you created the site using default settings, that is `skupper init`, a random password is generated for the `admin` user.
To retrieve the password:

.. Retrieve the encoded password for the `admin` user:
+
----
$ oc get secret skupper-console-users -o yaml| grep admin

admin: Sk5aV3pNSHR5Zw==
----
.. Decode the password for the `admin` user:
+
----
$ echo -n "Sk5aV3pNSHR5Zw==" | base64 --decode

== Exploring the {skupper-name} console

The {skupper-name} console provides an overview of the following:

* Services - services that are exposed on the {service-network}, both local and remote.
* Sites - {skupper-name} installations on the current {service-network}.
* Deployments - deployments relating to exposed services.

. Perform the {OpenShiftTutorialLink} tutorial.

. Navigate to the {skupper-name} console.

. Click the *Sites* menu item.
Both the *east* and *west* sites should be displayed in circles.

. Drag and drop the *west* circle to be on the left of the *east* circle.

. Click the *Table* tab to display the sites as text items.
This view allows you drill down into details relating to the selected site.

. Click the *Deployments* menu item.
This view shows you any deployments that are exposed as services on the {service-network}.
In this case, the console displays the *hello-world-backend (east)* deployment.

. Click the *Services* menu item to display details for all services exposed on the {service-network}.
+
NOTE: Although two services are involved in the tutorial, only one service, `hello-world-backend` is exposed on the {service-network}.

. Click the *Sites* menu again and expand the panel on the right hand side of the console.
This panel shows the traffic flows from the backend to the frontend.
